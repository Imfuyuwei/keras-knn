This respository contains the example code for the blog post [Nearest Neighbors with Keras and CoreML](https://hackernoon.com/nearest-neighbors-with-keras-and-coreml-755e76fedf36).

The example notebook shows how you can use Keras to build a
cosine-based k-nearest neighbors model (k-NN) on top of an existing deep
network. The notebook also has an example of converting the model to CoreML
for use on iPhone or other iOS devices.
